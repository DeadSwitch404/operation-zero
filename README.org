* Overview
Ghost Automation is the DeadSwitch infrastructure automation framework.
It's a self-contained Ghost Automation project.
It provides hardened, reproducible machine configurations using Ansible.
Every role is designed for security, minimalism, and validation.

The goal: any bare machine can be turned into the part of the
Ghost Infrastructure with one playbook.

* Structure
#+begin_example
playbooks/       → Entry point playbooks
roles/           → Modular roles (ds-*)
scripts/         → Scripts handling automation steps
ansible.cfg      → Ansible configuration
#+end_example

* Roles
| Role          | Purpose                                                              |
|---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =ds-users=    | Create users, groups, and deploy SSH keys. Set the initial password. |
| =ds-sudo=     | Manage sudoers safely with validation.                               |
| =ds-ssh=      | Configure SSH access for users.                                      |
| =ds-firewall= | Manage firewall rules (default deny input, explicit allow).          |

Each role ships with its own =README.org= describing variables, structure, and usage.

* Playbooks
- =play-configure-machine.yml= :: Base playbook to provision a host with all DeadSwitch roles.

Example usage:
#+begin_src shell
ansible-playbook -i inventories/hosts.yml playbooks/play-configure-machine.yml
#+end_src

This playbook runs the baseline:
#+begin_example
- ds-users
- ds-sudo
- ds-ssh
- ds-firewall
#+end_example

* Inventories
Inventories must be organized as:
- =hosts.yml=    → main inventory of target machines
- =group_vars/=  → group-level variables
- =host_vars/=   → host-specific variables

Use Ansible Vault or SOPS for secrets.

Example =hosts.yml=:
#+begin_src yaml
ghost_infrastructure:
  ansible_host: 192.168.122.100
  ansible_user: switch
  ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /usr/share/keys/ghost_automation
#+end_src

* Development
- Use Python virtual environment (=.venv=) for isolation.
- Run =ansible-lint= and =yamllint= before commits.
- Future: Molecule scenarios for each role (test each role in isolation).

* Safety
- Sudo configurations validated with =visudo=.
- Groups are created before being assigned to users.
- SSH hardening applied cautiously to prevent lockouts.
- Firewall is deny-first, require explicit allow.
- Principle: *secure by default, flexible by variable*.
