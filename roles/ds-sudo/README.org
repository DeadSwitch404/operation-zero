#+TITLE: DeadSwitch SUDO Role
#+AUTHOR: DeadSwitch | The Silent Architect
#+OPTIONS: toc:t num:t \n:nil

* Overview
This role manages =sudo= installation and configuration on Debian-based systems.  
It ensures a minimal, safe =/etc/sudoers= baseline, while delegating all privilege management into =/etc/sudoers.d/= files.  

Validation is enforced with =visudo -cf= to prevent lockouts.  

User and group definitions are collected from =ds-users=:
- Users may have a =sudo= branch in =user_data=.
- Groups may have a =sudo= branch in =group_data=.
- Groups referenced in =user_data.groups= are created by =ds-users= and can
  then be granted sudo privileges here.

* Features
- Installs the =sudo= package if missing.
- Configures per-user sudo access.
- Configures per-group sudo access.
- Supports =NOPASSWD:ALL= (use with care).
- Supports =NOPASSWD= for restricted command lists.
- Ensures all generated files are validated with =visudo -cf=.

* Variables

** =user_data=
Consumed from =ds-users=. *Only* the =sudo= branch is used here.

#+begin_src yaml
user_data:
  user1:
    ssh_key: "ssh-rsa ..."
    groups:
      - ansible
    sudo:               # This branch is used
      type: nopasswd    # for per-user sudo config
      commands: all
#+end_src

** =group_data=
Consumed from =ds-users=. Only the =sudo= branch is used here.

#+begin_src yaml
group_data:
  ansible:
    sudo:               # This branch is used
      type: nopasswd    # for per-group sudo config
      commands: all
#+end_src

* Examples

** Restricted sudo for a user

#+begin_src yaml
user_data:
  admin:
    ssh_key: "ssh-rsa ..."
    groups:
      - wheel
    sudo:
      type: nopasswd
      commands:
        - /usr/bin/systemctl
        - /usr/sbin/adduser
        - /usr/sbin/addgroup
#+end_src

** Full sudo for a group

#+begin_src yaml
group_data:
  ansible:
    sudo:
      type: nopasswd
      commands: all
#+end_src

* Templates

| Template            | Function                          |
|---------------------+-----------------------------------|
| =ds-sudo-users.j2=  | Generates *per-user* sudo rules.  |
| =ds-sudo-groups.j2= | Generates *per-group* sudo rules. |

* Safety
- All files are placed under =/etc/sudoers.d/= with mode =0440=.
- Every change is validated with =visudo -cf %s=.
- The main =/etc/sudoers= remains minimal and untouched.
