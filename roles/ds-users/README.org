#+TITLE: DeadSwitch User Management Role
#+AUTHOR: DeadSwitch | The Silent Architect
#+OPTIONS: toc:t num:t \n:nil

* Overview
This role manages user and group creation, as well as public SSH key deployment, on
Debian-based systems. It ensures that users exist, that their groups are
created and assigned correctly, and that their SSH keys are installed.
The role can set up the initial password.
Privilege configuration is delegated to the =ds-sudo= role.

* Features
- Creates users defined in =user_data=.
- Ensures groups exist:
  - Groups explicitly listed in =user_data.groups=.
  - Groups defined in =group_data=.
- Adds users to groups (using =append: yes= to preserve existing memberships).
- Deploys SSH keys per user.
- Sets the user's full name (GECOS field) if provided.
- Fully compatible with =ds-sudo= for privilege management.

* Role Variables

** =user_data=
Dictionary of users and their attributes:

#+begin_src yaml
user_data:
  user1:
    ssh_key: "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQCjvz101..."
    full_name: "DeadSwitch"
    password: "*"
    groups:
      - ansible
    sudo:               # Ignored by ds-users; consumed by ds-sudo
      type: nopasswd
      commands: all
#+end_src

- =ssh_key=   → optional; if defined, will be deployed to =~/.ssh/authorized_keys=.
- =full_name= → optional; sets the user's GECOS/comment field.
- =prompt=    → optional; sets the BASH prompt of the user (=.bashrc=).
- =password=  → optional; sets the password only at user creation; defaults to ="*"=.
- =groups=    → optional; list of groups to add the user to.
- =sudo=      → ignored by =ds-users=; passed through for use by =ds-sudo=.

For real password hashes, store them in an Ansible Vault in the =vault_data= hash.
(Hash the passwords with ~openssl passwd -6~)

** =group_data=
Dictionary of groups. Groups may also be defined here, typically with sudo
attributes for =ds-sudo=.

#+begin_src yaml
group_data:
  ansible:
    sudo:             # Used only by ds-sudo
      type: nopasswd
      commands: all
#+end_src

** =vault_data=
Dictionary from an encrypted file that gets merged to =user_data=.

#+begin_src yaml
vault_data:
  user1:
    password: "$6$hashedpassword"
#+end_src

* Examples

** Minimal user creation
#+begin_src yaml
user_data:
  alice:
    groups:
      - ansible
#+end_src

This will create the =ansible= group if missing, then create user =alice= and
add them to that group.

** Full example with SSH key and sudo (sudo handled by ds-sudo)
#+begin_src yaml
user_data:
  deadswitch:
    ssh_key: "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQCjvz101..."
    full_name: "DeadSwitch"
    password: "*"
    groups:
      - ansible
    sudo:
      type: nopasswd
      commands: all
#+end_src

In an encrypted file:

#+begin_src yaml
vault_data:
  deadswitch:
    password: "$6$hashedpassword"
#+end_src

* Safety
- Existing users and group memberships are preserved; =append: yes= is used.
- Groups are auto-created if referenced in either =user_data= or =group_data=.
- SSH keys are only deployed if defined.
- Password is set only at user creation. Default: "*" (account locked, SSH-only authentication)
- Sudo privileges are not modified by this role; use =ds-sudo=.
